# Customer_segmentation_R
Performed analysis on the Mall _dataset used K means clustering algorithm to develop relationship between columns and visualized the final results.
This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using the RFM model (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) and K-means clustering in R. The dataset used for this analysis is the Online Retail Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Results
[https://customer-segmentation-429ce.web.app]

# The project is implemented in R and uses the following libraries:
```
dplyr
ggplot2
factoextra
clValid
```
# The main steps of the project are as follows:

# 1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
Calculating RFM scores for each customer
Determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
Performing K-means clustering on the RFM scores
Analyzing the clusters and interpreting the results
